# Changenotifier
- It's a broadcaster. When your app's data changes, it informs all the listeners (widgets) that rely on it, prompting them to rebuild with updated values.
  
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

// CountProvider is a ChangeNotifier, which allows widgets listening to it to rebuild when notifyListeners() is called.
class CountProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Private variable to store the count value (starts at 50)
  int _count = 50;

  // Getter to expose the private _count variable to other widgets
  int get count => _count;

  // Method to increment the count and notify listeners that a change occurred
  void setCount() {
    _count++; // Increase the count by 1
    notifyListeners(); // Notify all widgets listening to this provider to rebuild
  }
}
```

## üß† What is `CountProvider`?

`CountProvider` is a simple **state management class** in Flutter using `ChangeNotifier`. It allows you to:

* Keep track of a count.
* Notify widgets when the count changes so they can rebuild automatically.

---

## üßæ Code Explanation

### üîí `_count`

```dart
int _count = 50;
```

* This is a **private variable** (due to the `_`) that holds the current count.
* Starts at `50`.

---

### üëÅ `get count`

```dart
int get count => _count;
```

* This is a **getter** to allow widgets to **read** the `_count` value.
* Widgets can‚Äôt change it directly‚Äîonly read.

---

### üîº `setCount()`

```dart
void setCount() {
  _count++;
  notifyListeners();
}
```

* Increases the `_count` by 1.
* Calls `notifyListeners()`, which **tells all listening widgets to rebuild** and reflect the new count.

---

## üí° When to Use This?

Use `CountProvider` in your Flutter app when you want to:

* Keep track of a value like a counter.
* Rebuild parts of your UI automatically when the value changes.

---

## üß© Example Usage

In your `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CountProvider(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

In a widget:

```dart
Consumer<CountProvider>(
  builder: (context, provider, child) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: ${provider.count}'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: provider.setCount,
          child: Text('Increase'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
```

## üìå Summary

| Part                | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `_count = 50`       | Stores the initial count value                 |
| `get count`         | Returns current count (read-only)              |
| `setCount()`        | Increases count and notifies UI                |
| `notifyListeners()` | Makes widgets that use `CountProvider` rebuild |

---

## What is `Consumer`?

`Consumer` is a widget provided by the [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package in Flutter.
It **listens** to changes in a provider and **rebuilds only the widget inside it** when the data changes.

---

## Why Use `Consumer`?

* To access the latest data from a provider.
* To rebuild only a **specific part of the UI** instead of the whole widget.
* Improves performance by reducing unnecessary rebuilds.

---

## Simple Usage

```dart
Consumer<CountProvider>(
  builder: (context, countProvider, child) {
    return Text('Count: ${countProvider.count}');
  },
)
```

### üîç Explanation

| Part                      | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Consumer<CountProvider>` | Tells Flutter to listen to the `CountProvider`.                        |
| `builder:`                | A function that returns a widget every time the value updates.         |
| `context`                 | The widget's context.                                                  |
| `countProvider`           | The actual provider instance you can use to read data or call methods. |
| `child`                   | A constant part of the UI that doesn't rebuild (optional).             |

## üßæ Summary

| Feature     | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Consumer`  | Listens to changes in a provider.              |
| `builder`   | Builds the widget every time the data changes. |
| Performance | Only the widget inside `Consumer` rebuilds.    |

---

**Tip:** Use `listen: false` with `Provider.of<T>` when you want to **call a method** but don‚Äôt want the widget to rebuild.

```dart
Provider.of<CountProvider>(context, listen: false).setCount();
```
